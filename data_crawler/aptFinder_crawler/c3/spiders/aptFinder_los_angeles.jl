Blackstone is a vibrant community of artists, taste makers, stakeholders and entrepreneurs and is steps away from some of the best cultural events, restaurants and shopping that Los Angeles has to offer. We are especially excited for the opening of the flagship Apple store coming a block away.\n\nBlackstone Apartments are traditional in nature, with walls and doors separating the living rooms from the bedrooms and for both the one and two bedroom units. The apartments all boast real 3/4 inch hardwoods floors, walk in closets, pantries, coat closets, 10ft windows, 15ft ceilings, and custom kitchens with all black granite counters, farm stinks, and Hansgrophe faucets. The apartments do not have any exposed conduit, pipes or air conditioning systems.

Parkinson, in collaboration with other architects, went on to design some of Los Angeles\u2019 most iconic buildings, including LA City Hall, the LA Coliseum and Downtown\u2019s Union Station. In 1939, Blackstone was sold and had extensive renovations which gave it the current Streamline Modern style at the street level and in 2003 designated Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument #765. Today, the Blackstone is situated between the Eastern Columbia, the most photographed building in Los Angeles and the Ace Hotel and Theatre. Blackstone was adaptively reused and converted in 2010 to house 82 apartments with ground floor retail and a subterranean parking garage.\n\n\n\nThe Mayan Theatre\nBlue Jam Cafe\nThe Hoxton\nGlobe Theatre\nPaul Smith Store\nRalph's Fresh Faire", "office_hour": {"Monday": {"time_open": "9AM", "time_close": "5PM"}, "Tuesday": {"time_open": "9AM", "time_close": "5PM"}, "Wednesday": {"time_open": "9AM", "time_close": "5PM"}, "Thursday": {"time_open": "9AM", "time_close": "5PM"}, "Friday": {"time_open": "9AM", "time_close": "5PM"}, "Saturday": {"time_open": "9AM", "time_close": "5PM"}, "Sunday": {"time_open": "10AM", "time_close": "5PM"}}, "special_features": ["Bluetooth speakers", "Hardwood Floors Super High Ceilings", "Has NEST Thermostat", "Large Unit With Great Views", "NEST Thermostat", "Nest Thermostat, Bluetooth Speakers", "On Site underground garage", "Philips HUE Lighting", "South Park - Best Location", "Wireless Bluetooth Speakers In Ceiling"], "community_features": ["Laundry Facilities", "Maintenance on site", "Furnished Units Available", "On-Site ATM", "On-Site Retail", "Hearing Impaired Accessible", "Vision Impaired Accessible", "Recycling", "Renters Insurance Program", "Dry Cleaning Service", "Laundry Service", "Maid Service", "Online Services", "Planned Social Activities", "Elevator", "Storage Space", "Disposal Chutes", "Vintage Building", "Courtyard", "Fitness Center"], "floorplan_amenities": ["High Speed Internet Access", "Wi-Fi", "Air Conditioning", "Heating", "Smoke Free", "Cable Ready", "Satellite TV", "Storage Units", "Tub/Shower", "Surround Sound", "Intercom", "Sprinkler System", "Wheelchair Accessible", "Dishwasher", "Disposal", "Granite Countertops", "Stainless Steel Appliances", "Pantry", "Island Kitchen", "Eat-in Kitchen", "Kitchen", "Oven", "Range", "Refrigerator", "Freezer", "Hardwood Floors", "Carpet", "Crown Molding", "Vaulted Ceiling", "Bay Window", "Views", "Walk-In Closets", "Linen Closet", "Loft Layout", "Window Coverings"], "parking": [], "pet_policy": "Dogs and Cats Allowed", "airport": {"Los Angeles International": {"drive": "24 min", "distance": "14.6 mi"}, "Bob Hope": {"drive": "27 min", "distance": "15.9 mi"}}, "universities": {"The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising": {"drive": "2 min", "distance": "0.6 mi"}, "Golden Gate University": {"drive": "2 min", "distance": "0.8 mi"}, "Los Angeles Trade-Tech": {"drive": "4 min", "distance": "1.5 mi"}}, "park_recreation": {"Vista Hermosa Natural Park": {"drive": "5 min", "distance": "1.9 mi"}, "MacArthur Park Lake": {"drive": "5 min", "distance": "2.1 mi"}, "Echo Park Lake": {"drive": "6 min", "distance": "2.9 mi"}, "Hollenbeck Lake": {"drive": "6 min", "distance": "3.0 mi"}, "Exposition Park Rose Garden": {"drive": "7 min", "distance": "3.4 mi"}}, "shopping_mall": {"Strip Center at 940 S Hill St": {"drive": "1 min", "distance": "0.2 mi"}, "Strip Center at 934 S Los Angeles St": {"drive": "1 min", "distance": "0.3 mi"}, "Strip Center at 1017-1041 S Los Angeles St": {"drive": "1 min", "distance": "0.4 mi"}}, "military_bases": {"Los Angeles Air Force Base": {"drive": "23 min", "distance": "15.1 mi"}, "National Guard Armory South Bay Cities": {"drive": "26 min", "distance": "18.6 mi"}}, "transit": {"7th Street/Metro Center Station": {"drive": "12 min", "distance": "0.6 mi"}, "Pershing Square Station": {"drive": "12 min", "distance": "0.6 mi"}, "Pico Station": {"drive": "16 min", "distance": "0.8 mi"}, "San Pedro Station": {"drive": "3 min", "distance": "1.4 mi"}, "Grand Station": {"drive": "4 min", "distance": "1.6 mi"}}, "commuter_rail": {"Union Station": {"drive": "5 min", "distance": "2.0 mi"}, "Cal State LA": {"drive": "8 min", "distance": "5.9 mi"}}}
